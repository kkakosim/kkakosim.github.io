Thermal regulation of a photovoltaic system using a phase change material is an effective technique, but a careful selection of PCM in terms of its thermophysical properties is essential for its better performance. In this work, performance analysis of a novel medium concentrated photovoltaic system employing two mono-facial polycrystalline cells is carried out. The system is thermally regulated with a phase change material. An experimentally validated finite element-based coupled optical, thermal, and electrical model is used to analyze the system’s performance. The impact of the thermophysical properties of a PCM such as melting temperature, thermal conductivity, and heat of fusion on the thermal regulation of the system is studied using artificial neural networking methods. The optimum thermophysical properties of the PCM are determined using parametric analysis for the ambient temperatures ranging between 25 and 50 °C and a concentration ratio of 20×. Moreover, the performance of the system is analyzed using the optimum PCM for the semi-arid weather conditions of Lahore, Pakistan and the optimum PCM for oceanic weather conditions of Waterford, Ireland. It is found that the melting temperature, thermal conductivity, and heat of fusion of the PCM have a linearly indirect relationship with the temperature of the photovoltaic system while the ambient temperature has a linearly direct relationship with the photovoltaic system’s temperature. The melting temperature of a PCM should be 10–15 °C higher than the ambient temperatures up to the ambient temperature of 40 °C. The melting temperature of a PCM was found to be 5 – 10 °C higher than the ambient temperatures for ambient temperatures greater than 40 °C. The required thermal conductivity of a PCM increases with the increase in ambient temperature ranging from 10 to 12 Wm-1K−1 for the ambient temperature of 25 °C while 18–20 Wm-1K−1 for the ambient temperature of 50 °C. The suitable heat of fusion is found in the range of 210–220 kJkg−1. It is found that the optimum PCM for Lahore has melting temperature, thermal conductivity, and heat of fusion of 53–56 °C, 19 Wm-1K−1 and 220 kJkg−1 respectively. The optimum PCM for Waterford has melting temperature, thermal conductivity, and heat of fusion of 35–37 °C, 11 Wm-1K−1 and 220kJkg−1 respectively. The maximum temperature of concentrated photovoltaic cell for Lahore, Pakistan remains below 83 °C, while for Waterford, Ireland, it is below 59 °C for all the months in a year. From April to August, the output power is higher for Waterford with an average difference of 12%, while from September to March, Lahore has the higher power output with an average difference of 47%. The maximum power obtained for Lahore is 0.185kWh/day/m2, while for Ireland it is 0.213kWh/day/m2. A maximum deviation of 6% is found for electrical output and less than 3% for thermal output between simulated and experimental results during validation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN5737" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A scalable approach using a gC(3)N(4)-covalent organic framework hybrid catalyst towards sustainable hydrogen production from seawater and wastewater</div> <div class="author"> K.

While numerous reports have focused on the production of H(2) from deionized water using COFs, the inability to produce H(2) from industrial wastewater or seawater is a common limitation in many reported catalysts. Additionally, many of these reports lack a clear path to scale up the catalyst synthesis. In this study, we explore the prospect of hybridizing a COF with gC(3)N(4) to create a robust photocatalyst for efficient H(2) generation. This hybrid exhibits outstanding performance not only in deionized water, but also in wastewater, and simulated seawater. Furthermore, we explore the feasibility of the bulk-scale synthesis and successfully produce a 20 g hybrid catalyst in a single batch, and the synthesis method is scalable to achieve the commercial target. Remarkably, a maximum HER rate of 94 873 mumol g(-1) h(-1) and 109 125 mumol g(-1) h(-1) was obtained for the hybrid catalyst from industrial wastewater and simulated seawater, respectively. The performance of bulk-scale batches closely matches that of the small-scale ones. This research paves the way for the utilization of organic photocatalysts on a commercial scale, offering a promising solution for sustainable large-scale H(2) production.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN5518" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Optimizing stability through conformational locking and ring fusion modulation in organic semiconductors</div> <div class="author"> S.

The S, N heteroacene type TTP core exhibits complete planarity and enhanced electron richness compared to the BDD core, paving the way for fine tuning the morphology, optoelectronic properties, and frontier molecular energy levels in donor-acceptor-type materials. Side-chain engineering resulted in a balanced electron-rich nature of the monomer and enhanced solubility/processability of the resulting polymers. These molecular strategies for PTTP1-BDT contribute to improved stability and morphology, crucial for organic electronic device applications. Incorporation of PTTP1-BDT and PBDB-T as donor polymers in organic photovoltaics resulted in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of similar to 3% for PTTP1-BDT and similar to 8% for PBDB-T. The compromise in PTTP1-BDT based device efficiency was attributed to lower and unbalanced charge mobility.

Environmentally benign technologies for alternative fuel production in the form of hydrogen can be developed via heterogenous photocatalysis, a process based on utilization of solar energy. To this end, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) based photocatalyst was developed, doped with MoS2 in a one-pot solvothermal synthesis technique, and coupled with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as a carbonaceous support. The material exhibiting the highest rate of hydrogen evolution, CM5C3, involved a MWCNTs loading of 3% and MoS2 loading of 5%. Compared to pure CdS synthesized with the same adapted procedure, the 3% CNT loading improved the rate of hydrogen production by nearly 7-fold, and the optimal 5% MoS2 loading further improved the performance by 60%. CM5C3, achieved an apparent quantum efficiency of 7.34%, a 26-fold increase compared to pure CdS. FESEM and HRTEM imaging confirmed the nanorod-like growth of CdS–MoS2 on the CNT surface, with elemental mapping confirming homogenous dispersion of MoS2 and CNTs. In addition, lattice fringe spacings indicated the presence of cubic and hexagonal CdS growing predominantly along the (111) and (002) planes respectively, in addition to MoS2 distributed throughout the crystal lattice. XRD analysis confirmed the presence of hexagonal and cubic CdS, however, MoS2 phases were not registered perhaps due to the low concentration present in the bulk of the material. XPS survey scans showed the presence of C, Cd, Mo, and S only, with trace oxygen impurities. Peak deconvolution indicated the presence of characteristic peaks for CdS and MoS2, in addition to evidence of the presence of Cd–C bonds, indicating strong CdS heterojunctions to the CNT surface.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN5517" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Nomograph derivation for underwater sour gas releases in shallow waters based on computational fluid dynamics simulations</div> <div class="author"> W.

This study suggests a transient Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for assessing the environmental impact of sour gas releases in shallow, ecologically sensitive waters. Employing the Realizable k-epsilon turbulence model and additional bubble plume mechanisms, the model was rigorously validated against welldocumented experimental data, showing high levels of agreement across multiple metrics. Key environmental safety parameters-such as rise time and H2S surface gas concentration, indicative of toxic exposure risk to aquatic life and human health-were extracted for multiple release scenarios. To present generalized and easily accessible data, these parameters were nondimensionalized and incorporated into a nomograph, enabling environmental risk assessments to be conducted four orders of magnitude faster than with high-fidelity simulations. The study emphasizes the nomograph’s utility in rapid, environmentally relevant risk assessment and emergency planning for mitigating the impact of sour gas spills. An error and sensitivity analysis revealed uncertainties of +/- 7 % for rise time and +/- 58 % for surface gas concentration, pinpointing avenues for future research.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN5679" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Review of techniques, challenges, and gaps in the subsurface gas release knowledge base</div> <div class="author"> O.

Despite their importance, operational challenges and external interferences can lead to underground gas leaks with potentially catastrophic consequences for both human safety and the environment. The presence of a protective soil bed introduces complexities in understanding subsurface transport phenomena and quantifying gas releases accurately. Herein, this review presents a systematic analysis of published research in the field of underground gas releases, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches that connect the lithosphere and atmosphere. The analysis highlights the broad spectrum of employed methods, including theoretical models based on fundamental principles, empirical formulations derived from experimental data, and sophisticated computational tools. A clear fundamental understanding and computational analysis, and to a lesser extent experimental, have been established to describe the migration regime. In contrast, more empirical research has addressed the crater formation regime, though focus was given to the far-field modelling following the soil ejection rather than the transient phenomena leading to the formation of the crater. Additionally, this review touches upon practical and conceptual topics, such as detection and localization techniques, and flow regimes in other gaseous flows through soil and powder beds, putting into question the applicability of some presumed granulated concepts to the flowing behavior expected beyond migration. The research landscape predominantly focuses on investigating the influence of release parameters on the release phenomena only from the atmospheric or soil domain perspective. This work provides insights that aim to first transcend both domains and then bridge the three distinct flow regimes-migration, uplift, and crater formation-despite the limited acknowledgment of the necessity of addressing all regimes concurrently through a universal approach. This review serves as a valuable resource for engineers to develop innovative solutions for the management of risks associated with underground gas leaks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN5147" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Optical and experimental evaluation of a directly irradiated solar reactor for the catalytic dry reforming of methane</div> <div class="author"> Tayseir M.

It is a CO2-assisted process that leads to the conversion of CO2 to higher-value products but is also a highly endothermic process that requires significant amounts of energy in the form of CO2 emitting fuels. For these reasons, this study focused on the direct utilization of concentrated solar energy by irradiating the catalyst directly rather than via a heat transfer fluid or conductive heat transfer. In addition, it uniquely adopts a tubular reactor with transparent (quartz) walls configuration, which allows extending the length of the irradiated (hot) zone to control the residence time. The new reactor was designed using Monte-Carlo ray-tracing modeling and evaluated experimentally using a commercial Ni-based catalyst. In brief, the reacting gas mixture (CH4:CO2 − 5 %: 5 %) was fed into the reactor at weight gas hourly space velocities of around 17–58 l h−1g−1 and three different temperature levels (550 °C, 650 °C, and 800 °C). Although the non-conventional mode of heating, the achieved methane conversions (∼93 % at 800 °C to ∼ 53 % at 550 °C) and H2 / CO ratios (∼0.9 at 800 °C to ∼ 0.4 at 550 °C) were similar to literature studies with the same catalyst. At the same time, the quartz walls showed no degradation after more than 80 h of intermittent testing. On the other hand, the overall energy efficiency was estimated to be less than 1 %, considering the radiation intercepted by the reactor system. However, it rose to 5 % − 25 % when correcting for the actual amount of irradiance on the catalytic bed.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN5481" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A receptor-centric decision support system for the mitigation of nuclear power atmospheric release incidents</div> <div class="author"> A.

Additionally, the recent energy crisis has reaffirmed the enduring necessity of nuclear energy. While a host of assessments, planning, and response fundamentals exist, the literature lacks specific directives for their implementation. Notably, despite a wealth of studies employing the entire suite of available tools (i.e., source release, atmospheric dispersion and deposition, food contamination, and human exposure) for hypothetical or actual cases, the majority tend to focus on the source and fate of nucleoids. Given these circumstances, we propose a receptor-centric and data-driven framework to guide the selection and evaluation of such planning. This framework, which utilizes time-dependent source terms and the JRODOS system, is exemplified within a region home to multiple nuclear plants. Significantly, this new approach proved more robust than traditional wind-rose and worst-case methodologies in capturing a broader spectrum of potential outcomes. Though it was possible to prioritize and validate certain countermeasures, such as sheltering and food restrictions, using the innovative visualization methods within the framework, we identified several limitations. These weaknesses, along with potential avenues for future research, are discussed in this study, contributing valuable insights to this crucial field.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN5407" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Exploring and enhancing the volumetric behaviour in solar receivers through specular reflectivity and simplified design</div> <div class="author"> Fathya Salih and Konstantinos E.

The system utilizes a combination of ammonium sulfite and ammonium sulfate solution to represent wet flue gas desulfurization products from the ammonia scrubbing process commonly used in oil and gas producing countries. Under simulated sunlight, the sulfurous solution in the PEC system is oxidized at a reduced titania nanotube array (TNA) working electrode to produce hydrogen, a clean energy source (Energy). The oxidized sulfurous solution entering the draw solution (DS) compartment of the FO unit was then diluted when the FO system operates against simulated brackish water as the feed solution (FS, Water). The DS effluent is recirculated to ensure continuous operation of both PEC and FO systems. At a certain point in time, the DS effluent is also used as a cultivation solution for basil plants, the growth is visually more favorable compared to those supplied with tap water (Food). A concentrated DS (0.8:0.2 ratio of (NH4)2SO3:(NH4)2SO4) showed excellent water desalination performance. It had a high water flux of 17 LMH with 11.8 % water recovery, highest salt rejection (98.6 % for Na+ and 98.3 for Cl-), and lowest reverse solute flux (RSF) (3.5 g &amp; BULL;m- 2 &amp; BULL;h-1 for SO42- , 5.25 g &amp; BULL;m- 2 &amp; BULL;h-1 for SO32- , 3.1 g &amp; BULL;m- 2 &amp; BULL;h-1 for NH4+) against 5 g &amp; BULL;L-1 NaCl FS for 5 h, with a cathodic current density of 0.15 A &amp; BULL;cm- 2.

In this study, the contribution of locally generated fPM to air pollution and it’s environmental risk were assessed at a typical dry-arid area in the Middle East (i.e., State of Qatar, 200 x 200 km(2) domain) with the use of different emission and dispersion models. Four modelling scenarios were constructed to reflect standard practices (e.g., regional emission models and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Environmental Burden of Disease (EBD) method) and higher resolution calculations with emission models that were developed in past field campaigns. Emphasis was given to the effect on the WHO methodology beyond the typical emission estimates and ambient concentration levels. Eventually, the use of higher spatial resolution population and concentration data revealed fPM hot spots yielding up to 11.0 times higher short-term excess mortalities (an average increase of 1.8 times) compared to the baseline WHO methodology, where the whole population was exposed to a single average concentration. A difference that could be attributed to the improvement of the emission estimations for barren lands and traffic. For example, the estimated PM(10) emission fluxes from barren lands, within the main metropolitan area, using the improved emissions model ranged from 0.05 to 42.0 mug m(-2) s(-1), which is considerably higher than the emissions predicted using just the literature models (0.03 to 2.0 mug m(-2) s(-1)). Overall, the barren lands emissions accounted for more than 90% of the fPM emissions during the study period. Consequently, this study is one of the first to quantify the significance of locally induced fPM and highlight the need for dedicated field studies and improved emissions estimation tools.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN5406" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Conversion of boehmite to higher alumina phases by direct irradiation with concentrated light: Numerical modelling and experimental verification C3 - AIP Conference Proceedings</div> <div class="author"> K.

Many of the possible conversion routes incorporate particles or could be transformed into particle-phase reactions, with one of these promising routes being aerosol reactors directly illuminated with concentrating light. Directly irradiated particles in aerosol phase can combine the advantages of fast heat and mass transfer rates with higher optical efficiencies compared to indirect solar reactors. Therefore, this study utilized mathematical models and qualitative experiments to demonstrate the potential of such reactors and processes using the conversion of aluminum hydroxide particles (Boehmite or gibbsite) to higher Alumina phases. In particular, the numerical simulations showed the prospect of fine tuning a concentrated light driven aerosol (particle) process to achieve higher selectivity of specific products by taking advantage of the very high heat transfer rates and details of the reaction mechanism. This was also verified with complementary experiments of an immobilized bed of particles exposed to short duration concentrated light pulse. © 2022 Author(s).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN5148" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Toward a high-fidelity model for the identification of underground gas flow regimes resulting from buried pipeline releases</div> <div class="author"> O.

Conversely, this inhibits the accurate prediction of the risk arising from the underground transport of hazardous materials. This work proposed and qualitatively evaluated a computational model that spans a wide range of underground gas flow regimes, ranging from gas migration, to ground uplift, and crater formation, depending on the release characteristics. The model followed the multiphase Eulerian approach and adopted the standard k-omega turbulence model and the kinetic theory of granular flow for the ground description with the Syamlal-O’Brien granular viscosity expression. The model’s optimum configuration was checked against experimental data using a new mechanistic approach to link the qualitative observations with quantitative model outputs. The effect of pipeline pressure, burial depth, and release orientation on the regime was studied and the outcomes were utilized to enhance a literature nomograph for the flow regime identification. Emphasis was given to fill in the literature gaps and improve the delineation of the boundaries between the regimes rather than deriving specific quantities. The resulted nomograph is a cost-effective screening tool to identify the regime and select among the available strategies of risk assessment.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN4408" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Positioning and focusing of light sources in light concentrating systems using convolutional neural network modelling</div> <div class="author"> D.

Despite their expanding usage, they face some operational challenges that provide opportunities for new designs and further exploration. Accordingly, this study investigated the development and performance of a machine learning model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for HFSS operation and control. Specifically, the hypothesis proposed is that a CNN can predict three HFSS parameters (the relative x, y, z position of the light source) using imaging and computer vision techniques with an accuracy equal to or better than the operator. First, the HFSS output was characterized in detail to set the overall study expectations and serve as the baseline metric. Then, the optical modelling of the HFSS using Monte Carlo Ray Tracing was employed to generate more than 2,500 images for the training and validation of the CNN. Consequently, the hypothesis was validated as the CNN accurately predicted the source position within 0.07, 0.11, and 0.07 mm in the x-, y-, and z-directions, respectively (a Euclidean distance of similar to 0.249 mm). This is comparable to the mechanical system’s accuracy, which allows the positioning of the light source with a Euclidian distance of approximately 0.24 mm. Remarkably, this achievement allows for full automation and better control of light concentrating facilities and the development of more innovative energy harvesting systems.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN4381" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Towards a regional dust modeling system in the central Middle East: Evaluation, uncertainties and recommendations</div> <div class="author"> Serafim Kontos, Konstantinos Kakosimos, Natalia Liora, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

The modeling system consists of the natural emission model NEMO, the meteorological model WRF and the chemistry transport model CAMx. An extensive evaluation of 16 different configurations has been realized, incorporating all the combinations of the components utilized in the state-of-art dust modeling approaches, namely the drag partition, the sandblasting efficiency, the horizontal mass flux, as well two commonly used soil particle size distributions. Daily mean PM10 measurements in Doha, as well the satellite AOD products of MODIS have been used for the quantitative and the qualitative assessment of the simulations. Noteworthy, each of these assessments did not yield to the exact same ranking of the configurations (e.g. best five) but they assisted on identifying clear patterns. For example, a consistent overestimation of the daily mean PM10, when the MacKinnon’s drag partition scheme is utilized, was found. On the other hand, the assessments led to best three performing configurations, with common components the Raupach’s drag partition scheme and Alfaro and Gomes sandblasting efficiency. Although their overall performance is good, several issues were found i.e. on individual dust events and a mean underestimation during the studied period, ranging from −49 to −75 μg/m3. One cause of this underestimation could be the aerodynamic entrainment, a mechanism usually neglected from the dust modeling approaches. Another cause could be missed regional and/or local sources or underestimation of their emission rates.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN4125" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Comparative Analysis of a Novel Low Concentration Dual Photovoltaic/Phase Change Material System with a Non-Concentrator Photovoltaic System</div> <div class="author"> J.

Focus of this study is the prediction of PM (PM2.5 and PM10) infiltration at typical commercial and office building environments during severe dust storms. Therefore, a two-month field campaign was conducted to capture such an event in Doha, Qatar, and a modelling methodology is proposed based on the one-way coupling of a multi-zone and a computational fluid dynamics software. The predicted levels are in fair agreement with the measurements for both the dust storm and typical days, attributed to the accurate estimation of the external wind pressure and representation of the building envelope. The agreement further improves when the efficiency of the ventilation filters is estimated, from the measuremetns, rather than being extracted from specification sheets. Finally, predictions are found to conform with physical reality and to offer useful insights into PM building infiltration during dust storm events when cross examined with measurements.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN4921" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Synthesis and Photocyclization of Conjugated Diselenophene Pyrrole-2,5-dione Based Monomers for Optoelectronics</div> <div class="author"> Marc Comí, Michael U.

Particle number (PNC) and mass (PMC) concentrations and their integrated samples were collected for a period of three months for both PM10 and PM2.5 next to a trafficked road in the city of Doha, Qatar. Using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) on the elemental data of the samples, six distinct PM sources were identified: traffic exhaust, dust resuspension, fresh and aged sea salt, secondary aerosols, and fuel oil/shipping. Dispersion modelling and regression analysis were combined to derive EFs (linear analysis) and models (non-linear analysis) for the total traffic fleet (heavy and light duty). The estimated EFs were between 620 and 730 mg VKT-1 (VKT; Vehicle Kilometer Travelled) (adj. R-2 similar to 0.84) and between 1080 and 1410 mg VKT-1 (adj.

We aimed to (i) develop a tool to model exposures to air pollution and noise using harmonized inputs based on similar geographical structure (ii) explore the relationship (using Spearman’s rank correlation) of both pollutions at residential exposure level (iii) investigate the influence of traffic speed and Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) on air-noise relationship. The annual average (2005) air pollution (NO(x), NO(2), PM(10), PM(2.5)) and noise levels (L(day), L(eve), L(night), L(den), L(Aeq,24h)) are modelled at address locations in Copenhagen and Roskilde (N = 11,000 and 1500). The new AirGIS system together with the Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM(R)) is used to produce air pollution estimates. Whereas, noise is estimated using Common Noise Assessment Methods in the EU (CNOSSOS-EU, hereafter CNOSSOS) with relatively coarser inputs (100 m CORINE land cover, simplified vehicle composition). In addition, noise estimates (L(day), L(eve), L(night)) from CNOSSOS are also compared with noise estimates from Road Traffic Noise 1996 (RTN-96, one of the Nordic noise prediction standards). The overall air-noise correlation structure varied significantly in the range |r(S)| = 0.01-0.42, which was mainly affected by the background concentrations of air pollution as well as non-traffic emission sources. Moreover, neither AADT nor traffic speed showed substantial influence on the air-noise relationship. The noise levels estimated by CNOSSOS were substantially lower, and showed much lower variation than levels obtained by RTN-96. CNOSSOS, therefore, needs to be further evaluated using more detailed inputs (e.g. 10 m land cover polygons) to assess its feasibility for epidemiological noise exposure studies in Denmark. Lower to moderate air-noise correlations point towards significant potential to determine the independent health effects of air pollution and noise.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN4227" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Concept and demonstration of a fully coupled and dynamic exposure-response methodology for crowd evacuation numerical modelling in airborne-toxic environments</div> <div class="author"> N.

Various attempts have been made to improve simulation of evacuation in toxic environments and to account for the varying concentration levels and the dynamic exposure. However, most studies neglect the reverse effect, how the exposure and dosage levels affect the physical and psychological state of an evacuee and consequently the evacuation path and process. In this work, a fully coupled exposure-response-evacuation and agent based algorithm is proposed, focusing on the H(2)S airborne toxic. Accordingly, the dynamically estimated exposure of the evacuee affects, non-linearly, the evacuation speed and thus the overall evacuation. This coupling is challenging and thus it depends on the available epidemiological and toxicological data. Nevertheless, the diversity and advantages of the algorithm is successfully demonstrated over three case studies including single- and multi-agent in straight-path and building evacuation scenarios. For example, the building evacuation time increased by more than 50% by inclusion of the aforementioned coupling. In conclusion, herein, a gap on the evacuation modelling is addressed by a fully coupled methodology that could be easily adapted by safety engineers and further improved by researchers as more data become available.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN4124" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Implicit Definition of Flow Patterns in Street Canyons-Recirculation Zone-Using Exploratory Quantitative and Qualitative Methods</div> <div class="author"> A.

Street-scale Air Quality Models (AQMs) are a cheap and efficient way to study air pollution and possibly provide solutions. Having to include all the complex phenomena of wind flow between buildings, AQMs employ several parameterisations, one of which is the recirculation zone. Goal of this study is to derive an implicit or explicit definition for the recirculation zone from the flow in street canyons using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Therefore, a CFD-Large Eddy Simulation model was employed to investigate street canyons with height to width ratio from 1 to 0.20 under perpendicular wind direction. The developed dataset was analyzed with traditional methods (vortex visualization criteria and pollutant dispersion fields), as well as clustering methods (machine learning). Combining the above analyses, it was possible to extract qualitative features that agree well with literature but most importantly to develop quantitative expressions that describe their topology. The extracted features’ topology depends strongly on the street canyon dimensions and not surprisingly is independent of the wind velocity. The developed expressions describe areas with common flow characteristics inside the canyon and thus they can be characterised as an implicit definition for the recirculation zone. Furthermore, the presented methodology can be further applied to cover more parameters such us oblique wind direction and heated-facades and more methods for data analysis.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN3439" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Qualitative and Quantitative Investigation of Multiple Large Eddy Simulation Aspects for Pollutant Dispersion in Street Canyons Using OpenFOAM</div> <div class="author"> A.

Numerous studies reviewed the state-of-the-art models, proposed best-practice guidelines and explored, using various software, how different approaches (e.g., Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), large eddy simulations (LES)) inter-compare. Open source tools are continuously attracting interest but lack of similar, extensive and comprehensive investigations. At the same time, their configuration varies significantly among the related studies leading to non-reproducible results. Therefore, the typical quasi-2D street canyon geometry was selected to employ the well-known open-source software OpenFOAM and to investigate and validate the main parameters affecting LES transient simulation of a pollutant dispersion. In brief, domain height slightly affected street level concentration but source height had a major impact. All sub-grid scale models predicted the velocity profiles adequately, but the k-equation SGS model best-resolved pollutant dispersion. Finally, an easily reproducible LES configuration is proposed that provided a satisfactory compromise between computational demands and accuracy.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN3426" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Development and performance evaluation of new AirGIS - A GIS based air pollution and human exposure modelling system</div> <div class="author"> J.

We developed a substantially revised version of AirGIS (hereafter, new AirGIS) as a new modelling system in open-source GIS i.e. PostgreSQL software with its spatial extension PostGIS to (1) optimize the model performance enabling model calculations for a large number of sites over a large geographical area, with limited computing resources (2) replace the outdated programming language Avenue (3) become independent of commercial GIS software. This paper, therefore, aims to describe the overall structure of new AirGIS modelling system together with its strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the new AirGIS has been evaluated against various measured datasets of ambient air pollution (NOx, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5). In terms of reproducing temporal variation (single location, time series of concentrations e.g. annual, daily etc.) of air pollution, the new model achieved correlations (R) in the range 0.45-0.96. While, in terms of reproducing the spatial variation (several locations, single time interval), the new AirGIS achieved correlations in the range 0.32-0.92. The new model, therefore, can be used for both short- and long-term air pollution exposure assessments to facilitate health related studies. However, the present evaluation of the new modelling system also revealed that the new AirGIS significantly overestimated the observed concentrations for two out of four datasets. The possible reasons for these errors and future directions to reducing the bias in the new model output have been discussed.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN4121" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Computational investigation of the performance of ZIF-8 with encapsulated ionic liquids towards CO capture*</div> <div class="author"> A.

The influence of the IL anion-cation pair type is investigated through the combination of two different cations, namely 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium [bmim(+)] and 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium [omim(+)] and three distinct anions, namely bis-trifluoromethylsulfonyl-imide [Tf2N-], tricyanomethanide [TCM-], and tertracyanoborate [B(CN)(4)(-)], that can be encapsulated in ZIF-8, resulting in a series of ZIF hybrids (IL@ZIF-8). The study investigates the impact of the anion and the cation on the separation of CO2 from mixtures with CH4 and N-2. Monte Carlo simulations of adsorption of the three gases in both the pristine ZIF-8 and in ILs@ZIF-8 reveal that CO2 capacity increases dramatically for the case of ILs@ZIF-8. Moreover, analysis of the simulations and additional density functional theory calculations show that CO2/CH4 (related to natural gas purification) and CO2/N-2 (related to post-combustion CO2 capture) mixture selectivity is affected by the distribution, composition and type of the IL pair. Moreover, the sorbent selection parameter, S, and the regenerability factor, R, are used to evaluate the performance of all IL@ZIF-8 analogues along with other known CO2-selective materials.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN4122" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Micro-scale modelling of the urban wind speed for air pollution applications</div> <div class="author"> T.

Models for extrapolating the urban wind speed exist, but little attention has been paid to the influence of the upwind terrain and the foundations for the extrapolation schemes. To analyse the influence of the upwind terrain and the foundations for the extrapolation of the urban wind speed, measurements from six urban and non-urban stations were explored, and a model for the urban wind speed with and without upwind influence was developed and validated. The agreement between the wind directions at the stations is found to be good, and the influence of atmospheric stability, horizontal temperature gradients, land-sea breeze, temperature, global radiation and Monin-Obukhov Length is found to be small, although future work should explore if this is valid for other urban areas. Moreover, the model is found to perform reasonably well, but the upwind influence is overestimated. Areas of model improvement are thus identified. The upwind terrain thus influences the modelling of the urban wind speed to a large extent, and the fundamental assumptions for the extrapolation scheme are fulfilled for this specific case.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN1870" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Source reconstruction of airborne toxics based on acute health effects information</div> <div class="author"> C.

During these incidents, the greatest factor of uncertainty is related to the location and rate of released substance, therefore, an information of high importance for emergency preparedness and response plans. A novel computational algorithm is proposed to estimate, efficiently, the location and release rate of an airborne toxic substance source based on health effects observations; data that can be readily available, in a real accident, contrary to actual measurements. The algorithm is demonstrated by deploying a semi-empirical dispersion model and Monte Carlo sampling on a simplified scenario. Input data are collected at varying receptor points for toxics concentrations (C; standard approach) and two new types: toxic load (TL) and health effects (HE; four levels). Estimated source characteristics are compared with scenario values. The use of TL required the least number of receptor points to estimate the release rate, and demonstrated the highest probability (&gt;90%). HE required more receptor points, than C, but with lesser deviations while probability was comparable, if not better. Finally, the algorithm assessed very accurately the source location when using C and TL with comparable confidence, but HE demonstrated significantly lower confidence.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN2049" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Evaluation of an inverse modelling methodology for the prediction of a stationary point pollutant source in complex urban environments</div> <div class="author"> G.

Thus, estimating exposure to road traffic air and noise pollution (hereafter, air and noise pollution) is important in order to improve the understanding of human health outcomes in epidemiological studies. The aims of this review are (i) to summarize current practices of modelling and exposure assessment techniques for road traffic air and noise pollution (ii) to highlight the potential of existing tools and techniques for their combined exposure assessment for air and noise together with associated challenges, research gaps and priorities. The study reviews literature about air and noise pollution from urban road traffic, including other relevant characteristics such as the employed dispersion models, Geographic Information System (GIS)-based tool, spatial scale of exposure assessment, study location, sample size, type of traffic data and building geometry information. Deterministic modelling is the most frequently used assessment technique for both air and noise pollution of short-term and long-term exposure. We observed a larger variety among air pollution models as compared to the applied noise models. Correlations between air and noise pollution vary significantly (0.05-0.74) and are affected by several parameters such as traffic attributes, building attributes and meteorology etc. Buildings act as screens for the dispersion of pollution, but the reduction effect is much larger for noise than for air pollution. While, meteorology has a greater influence on air pollution levels as compared to noise, although also important for noise pollution.

Aim of this study is to assess the sensitivity of state-of-the art dust modules, utilized in multiple modelling schemes, and especially of their three main components; namely the horizontal mass flux, the drag partition and the sandblasting efficiency. To accomplish this, several simulations with the Natural Emission MOdel (NEMO), driven by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, were made for the period April-June 2015 focusing in the central Middle East (CME). First, the meteorological model was evaluated over the study period, as well as during a Shamal event, showing a satisfactory performance on wind speed which is the most important meteorological variable inserted in the dust modules. Second, dust emissions were found to be a few tenths of mu g/m(2) s on average, while the daily amount exceeds 1000 mg/m(2) day. Over the studied period, the fluxes range from 15 to 750 g/m(2). The total emissions in CME were estimated with the NEMO’s basic configuration at 139 Tg. The most active areas are associated with clay content ranging between 17 and 25%, highlighting the importance of soil texture on the definition of the dust sources. During a Shamal event in the second half of June 2015, the mean dust emission fluxes reached up to several hundreds of mu g/m(2) s, contributing 21 Tg in CME. Few such events could cover a large portion of the dust emissions. Finally, concerning the sensitivity of the total emissions, the drag partition scheme has the largest effect, followed by sandblasting efficiency and horizontal mass flux. The total dust emissions budget, among the 16 simulations was found to be in the range of 21-139 Tg, with the choice of the drag partition scheme to be mandatory for the narrowing of the total emissions in CME.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN1913" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Inverse identification of unknown finite-duration air pollutant release from a point source in urban environment</div> <div class="author"> I.

We optimized the calculation of the source-receptor function by developing a method which requires integrating as many backward adjoint equations as the available measurement stations. This resulted in high numerical efficiency of the method. The source parameters are computed by maximizing the correlation function of the simulated and observed concentrations.

A new indoor facility is developed that allows for investigation of the independent effect of irradiance and temperature on the thermal performance of the material. Two MAX namely, Titanium Aluminum Carbide (Ti(2)AIC) and Chromium Aluminum Carbide (Cr2AlC) are examined in this study. Both materials are exposed to high concentrated homogenized flux in the range of 527.2 kWm(-2) - 917 kWm(-2) for 1000 s and 3000 s using a high flux solar simulator while their temperatures are maintained at 60 degrees C +/- 5 degrees C via water-cooled heat flux gage. Materials’ surface characterization before and after irradiation is carried out using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray fluorescence analysis. It is found that both materials have excellent resistance to high concentrated flux, but that Ti(2)AIC shows higher light scattering due to the oxidation of its surface. It is also found that the variations in the optical properties over time do not depend on the selected incident flux level. The thermal performance of Ti2AlC and Cr2AlC was found to varies in the 0.56 - 0.68 and 0.60 - 0.67 range, respectively, for selected flux levels.

Such incidents might also jeopardize occupants of nearby indoor environments via infiltration of toxic contaminants. Despite that risk, there is still a lack of data and of comparative studies concerning the appropriate models and mitigation methods. The purpose of this work is, therefore, the improved modelling of toxic gas building infiltration, by a combination of tools and approaches. Using a realistic release scenario, the present comprehensive analysis demonstrates the need to consider the detailed building characteristics and meteorology. Significant deviations are observed between simple and advanced building ingress models. Furthermore, the consequences assessment leads to contradicting conclusions depending on the employed dose-response approaches. The proposed methodology could serve as a guide for the improvement of relevant risk-assessment tools and of future studies. (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The key improvement in relation to the previous version of the method lies in a two-step segregated approach. At first only the source coordinates are analysed using a correlation function of measured and calculated concentrations. In the second step the source rate is identified by minimizing a quadratic cost function. The validation of the new algorithm is performed by simulating the MUST wind tunnel experiment. A grid-independent flow field solution is firstly attained by applying successive refinements of the computational mesh and the final wind flow is validated against the measurements quantitatively and qualitatively. The old and new versions of the source term estimation method are tested on a coarse and a fine mesh. The new method appeared to be more robust, giving satisfactory estimations of source location and emission rate on both grids. The performance of the old version of the method varied between failure and success and appeared to be sensitive to the selection of model error magnitude that needs to be inserted in its quadratic cost function. The performance of the method depends also on the number and the placement of sensors constituting the measurement network. Of significant interest for the practical application of the method in urban settings is the number of concentration sensors required to obtain a "satisfactory" determination of the source. The probability of obtaining a satisfactory solution - according to specified criteria by the new method has been assessed as function of the number of sensors that constitute the measurement network.

The experimental part involves flow of LNG in a narrow trench filled with water and subsequent measurement of pool spreading and vaporization parameters. The numerical part involves CFD simulation using a three dimensional hybrid homogenous Eulerian multiphase solver to model the pool spreading and vaporization phenomenon. In this method, LNG is modeled as dispersed phase droplets which can interact with continuous phases - water and air through interphase models. The numerical study also employs a novel user-defined routine for capturing the LNG vaporization process. The CFD solver was capable of capturing the salient features of LNG pool spreading and vaporization phenomena.

Previous studies of the cycle omitted intermediate products, such as ammonium bisulfate, from the O-2 sub-cycle and, thus, neglected their potential impact on the cycle’s chemistry. Also, there are discrepancies in reported literature for the thermodynamic properties of ammonium sulfate, (NH4)(2)SO4, and ammonium bisulfate, NH4HSO4. In this study, thermal analysis experiments were conducted in order to determine the phase transition temperatures and enthalpies, and the heat capacity temperature dependence of the ammonium sulfate, (NH4)(2)SO4, and ammonium bisulfate, NH4HSO4. Our experimentally determined values for these parameters agree well with the data reported in DIPPR Project 801 database. Moreover, an exploratory thermodynamic analyses was performed using AspenPlus and FactSage, that included all potential reaction products, in order to identify critical parameters for an optimum O-2 sub-cycle. A methodology is proposed and evaluated to mitigate AspenPlue’s deficiency to handle solid phase changes. The thermodynamic analyses demonstrate that the NH4HSO4 inclusion in the O-2 sub-cycle reduces the overall process energy requirements, and allows its use as an energy storage medium. Finally, we show that the use of molten salts, in combination with their interactions, significantly affects the efficiency and the operating conditions of the process, as well as the state of the mixtures.

The use of a solar aerosol based reactor for the thermochemical steps of the cycle appears promising, therefore a particle model is required.

This study presents the results of chemical characterization of outdoor and indoor PM2.5 and PM10 in Doha city, over a two-month period including normal days and dust events, aiming at identifying the factors affecting the indoor air of an office building. The WHO guideline values were exceeded in 100% of the outdoor measurements. 49% of the days of the sampling campaign were characterized as non-dusty (PM10 &lt; 200 mu g m(-3)), 49% as minor-dusty (200 &lt; PM10 &lt; 1000 mu g m(-3)) while in one case (2%) there was a major-dusty day (PM10 &gt; 1000 mu g m(-3)). The contribution of both dust and anthropogenic emissions sources is depicted in particles’ mass and chemical composition. The elevated - especially outdoor-levels of carbonate carbon indicate the presence of crustal matter originating from the surrounding crustal material. OC/EC values reveal possible combined contribution from secondary organic aerosol, traffic-related sources and re-suspended dust. The influence of anthropogenic emissions is implied by the predominance of nitrate and sulfate ions, which constitute a substantial percentage of the particle mass. The crustal origin of particles is also depicted in metals. However, the higher enrichment factor values which may imply anthropogenic activities of both the outdoor and indoor environment were determined sequentially for Cd, Pb, As, Cu and Zn, suggesting the role of infiltration. Concluding, the indoor to outdoor relationship is significantly influenced by particles infiltration and penetration into the building mainly through the ventilation system and to a lesser extent, through windows or cracks in the building envelope. Although the low indoor to outdoor ratio underlies the predominance of outdoor levels compared to the indoor ones, there is positive correlation between indoor and outdoor PM, during the days that the building was open to the public and employees.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN1314" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Numerical Investigations of the Aperture Size Effect for Maintaining a Constant Temperature in a Novel Sulfur-Ammonia Water Splitting Cycle Application</div> <div class="author"> J.

In this paper, numerical work has been undertaken using a cylindrical solar receiver to investigate fixed and variable aperture sizes to maintain constant steady-state temperature over a day for thermochemical part of a novel hybrid photo-thermochemical sulfur-ammonia cycle. A previously developed and validated optical model in commercial software, TracePro (R) is used to simulate the light sources of 10, 15, and 28 kW The sunlight intensity variations for the designated reference day for this study is selected as July 1, 2011, at 39.74 N, 105.18 W and at an elevation of 1829 m. A developed and validated finite volume based coupled Monte Carlo, Heat Transfer model is used to calculate the steady-state temperatures in the receiver by utilizing the output of the optical model. The simulations are performed at different aperture diameters from 2 to 14 cm to quantify the effect of fixed aperture size on the steady-state temperatures of the receiver. Furthermore, simulations to maintain steady-state temperatures of 673, 823, and 1123 K for different sub-cycles of the selected cycle via variable aperture has been performed and compared with selected fixed apertures. It is found that the variable apertures can maintain desired constant temperatures over the day for each thermochemical sub-cycle.

However, existing solar TWSC face number of challenges that have slowed their practical application: (i) the utilization of only the thermal (IR) component of the solar irradiation, neglecting a photonic (UV-Vis) component, (ii) the intermittent nature of the solar resource, and (iii) the reliance on technically-challenging reagents transport and separation stages. This work presents the process simulation and preliminary sensitivity analysis of the hybrid photo-thermal sulfur-ammonia water splitting cycle; a novel photo-thermochemical process that takes advantage of a wider spectrum of the solar radiation. The developed process consists of mainly five-unit operations (a photochemical, three thermochemical &amp; an absorber). It incorporates also two thermal energy storage systems based on process fluids (molten salts and gases) rather than external heat transfer fluids. An optimum solar-to-H2 efficiency of 25.5 % was predicted, on the basis of 7,000 kmol.h-1 produced H2, higher than previous attempts. At the same time, to achieve this higher efficiency, higher reactor temperatures than those predicted by previous thermodynamic calculations are needed. Finally, the preliminary sensitivity analysis shows that mainly the mid-temperature thermochemical reactor and the composition of the feed affect the overall performance of the cycle.

A new hybrid photo-thermochemical sulfur ammonia (HySA) WSC developed at the Florida Solar Energy Center allows circumventing this shortcoming. In the HySA cycle, water splitting occurs by means of solar beam splitting which enables utilization of the quantum (UV-Vis) portion of the solar spectrum in the hydrogen production stage and the thermal (IR) portion in the oxygen production stage. Present work investigates the photocatalytic hydrogen production step using narrow band gap CdS and CdS-ZnS composite photocatalysts, and ammonium sulfite as an electron donor. The choice of the electron donor was determined by the considerations of its regenerability in the thermal stages of the HySA cycle. This article examines the impact of photocatalyst and cocatalystloading, temperature, and light intensity on hydrogen production rates. Photocatalysts, cocatalysts and photoreaction products were analyzed by a number of materials characterization (XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS) and analytical (GC and IC) methods. The experimental data obtained provide guidance for the improved solar photoreactor design. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is performed using HSC chemistry software and databases. The first (solar-based) step drives the thermal reduction of Sm2O3 into Sm and O-2. The second (non-solar) step corresponds to the production of H-2 via a water splitting reaction and the oxidation of Sm to Sm2O3. The equilibrium thermodynamic compositions related to the thermal reduction and water splitting steps are determined. The effect of oxygen partial pressure in the inert flushing gas on the thermal reduction temperature (T-H) is examined. An analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics is performed to determine the cycle efficiency ((cycle)) and solar-to-fuel energy conversion efficiency ((solar-to-fuel)) attainable with and without heat recuperation. The results indicate that (cycle) and (solar-to-fuel) both increase with decreasing T-H, due to the reduction in oxygen partial pressure in the inert flushing gas. Furthermore, the recuperation of heat for the operation of the cycle significantly improves the solar reactor efficiency. For instance, in the case where T-H = 2280 K, (cycle) = 24.4% and (solar-to-fuel) = 29.5% (without heat recuperation), while (cycle) = 31.3% and (solar-to-fuel) = 37.8% (with 40% heat recuperation).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN1313" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Simulated and measured perfomance investigation of a bioclimatic summer residence in Greece</div> <div class="author"> Maria Farmaki, Theodora Kyriafini, Marc Assael, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

However, accurate determination of fPM is an ongoing scientific challenge. The objective of this study is to examine (PM emissions from the loose Calcisols (i.e. soils with a substantial accumulation of secondary carbonates), owing to construction activities that can be frequently seen nowadays in arid urbanizing regions such as the Middle East. A two months field campaign was conducted at a construction site, at rest, within the city of Doha (Qatar) to measure number concentrations of PM over a size range of 0.25-32 mu m using light scattering based monitoring stations. The (PM emission fluxes were calculated using the Fugitive Dust Model (FDM) in an iterative manner and were fitted to a power function, which expresses the wind velocity dependence. The power factors were estimated as 1.87, 1.65, 2.70 and 2.06 for the four different size classes of particles &lt;= 2.5, 2.5-6, 6-10 and &lt;= 10 mu m, respectively. Fitted power function was considered acceptable given that adjusted R-2 values varied from 0.13 for the smaller particles and up to 0.69 for the larger ones. These power factors are in the same range of those reported in the literature for similar sources. The outcome of this study is expected to contribute to the improvement of PM emission inventories by focusing on an overlooked but significant pollution source, especially in dry and arid regions, and often located very close to residential areas and sensitive population groups. Further campaigns are recommended to reduce the uncertainty and include more (PM sources (e.g. earthworks) and other types of soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The Natural Emissions MOdel (NEMO) and the modelling system consisted of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) and the Comprehensive Air Quality model with extensions (CAMx) were applied in a 30 km horizontal resolution grid, which covered Europe and the adjacent areas for the year 2009. Air quality simulations were performed for different emission scenarios in order to study the contribution of each natural emission source individually and together to air quality levels in Europe. The simulations reveal that the exclusion of windblown dust emissions decreases the mean seasonal PM10 levels by more than 3.3 mu g/m(3) (similar to 20%) in the Eastern Mediterranean during winter while an impact of 3 mu g/m(3) was also found during summer. The results suggest that sea-salt aerosol has a significant effect on PM levels and composition. Eliminating sea-salt emissions reduces PM10 seasonal concentrations by around 10 mu g/m(3) in Mediterranean Sea during summer while a decrease of up to 6 mu g/m(3) is found in Atlantic Ocean during autumn. Sea-salt particles also interact with the anthropogenic component and therefore their absence in the atmosphere decreases significantly the nitrates in aerosols where shipping activities are present. The exclusion of biogenic emissions in the model runs leads to a significant reduction of secondary organic aerosols of more than 90% while an increase in PM2.5 levels in central Europe and Eastern Mediterranean is found due to their interaction with anthropogenic component.

In the present study, an iterative parameter estimation and identifiability analysis methodology is applied to an atmospheric model the Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM). To assess the predictive validity of the model, the data is split into an estimation and a prediction data set using two data splitting approaches and data preparation techniques (clustering and outlier detection) are analysed. The sensitivity analysis, being part of the identifiability analysis, showed that some model parameters were significantly more sensitive than others. The application of the determined optimal parameter values was shown to successfully equilibrate the model biases among the individual streets and species. It was as well shown that the frequentist approach applied for the uncertainty calculations underestimated the parameter uncertainties. The model parameter uncertainty was qualitatively assessed to be significant, and reduction strategies were identified. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The study investigates the effectiveness of coupling the prognostic MM5 mesoscale model with the CALMET diagnostic model for producing meteorological conditions that is characteristic of dry and arid regions like Qatar, with non-neutral boundary conditions. MM5-CALMET wind fields and temperature data are compared with the meteorological field observations from the Doha International Airport (DIA) on a monthly basis, daily basis and hourly basis to study the effect of different averaging periods. The monthly averages replicate the annual patterns of meteorological parameters very well. However difference in observation and model are observed for wind speed and wind direction variable. The daily averages obtained from the model are in good agreement with the observation for wind speed and temperature. For hourly averaging, the model is found capable of mimicking the temperature of a given location, but not wind speed and direction. The prediction of wind direction parameter using MM5-CALMET is moderate for any averaging period. The sub-optimal performance of wind direction variable is attributed to grid resolution of vertical and horizontal layers of MM5-CALMET model. Additionally a case study is performed to illustrate the effect of variation of meteorological parameters on the lower flammability limits (LFL) resulting from flammable dense gas release of LNG. The case study demonstrates the issues that arise in a risk analysis study when "wrong" meteorological data could be used. The overall study indicates that utilizing the coarsest prognostic meteorological model output in a diagnostic model provides an effective option for generating meteorological inputs for dispersion studies.

In most cases, this is realized by the imposition of specific emission standards, which usually are based on national and international experience. However, in areas with intense and dense polluting activities (e.g. industrial sites, trafficked roads) these horizontal measures will most probably fail to sustain local air quality. This is mainly because they do not consider the local transport mechanisms of pollutants from the source to the receptor. High local concentration levels might be the result of specific meteorological conditions, amplification owe to neighbour sources and deficient design of the air pollution control (APC) systems. Present work describes a conceptual and holistic approach based on the downwind optimisation, which takes into consideration also the transfer mechanisms that induce the ground level concentration of pollutants. This method can be used to design efficiently and dynamically control both the APC systems and the plant processes. Thus, local air quality can be sustained and protected in all cases and also achieve a significant reduction in capital and operational costs. Nevertheless, no cost-benefit analysis has been conducted here. The approach is also demonstrated in a comprehensive case study.

Something, which could lower their efficiency and limit their applicability. This paper presents a teaching methodology and the development of the related tools. A key aspect, of this methodology, is the collection of students’ feedback prior to lecture and additional detailed information on their learning progress. This information is then used to adapt course’s content. The methodology has been tested and demonstrated on a module of a Chemical Engineering Fluid Operations course. Three evaluation tools were implemented between modules of the same course and an equivalent control group. The qualitative evaluation showed an improvement on the students’ perception, a significant engagement and motivation. The quantitative evaluation showed no clear change between modules of the same course (with and without the proposed approach). On the other hand, an overall improvement was observed against the control group. Finally, significant effort was necessary to upgrade the existing teaching material to the level of the new tools. Something, which might discourage more instructors to adapt fully the proposed tools. Nevertheless, the findings related to the methodology are promising, and the tools development can take place gradually or even be directly adopted by the educational publishers. © 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN1430" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Investigation of the solar hybrid photo-thermochemical sulfur-ammonia water splitting cycle for hydrogen production</div> <div class="author"> A.

Therefore the need for hydrogen is experiencing a very rapid growth. At the same time, the traditional hydrogen production methods (e.g., steam methane reforming, water electrolysis) are energy and resources intensive. Thus, research focus is on sustainable technologies that can produce hydrogen in an economic and environmental friendly way. Hydrogen production via a solar driven hybrid sulfur-ammonia water splitting cycle (HySA) developed at Florida Solar Energy Center is such a promising technology. For this reason, it is important to design and study, beyond the conceptual level, an efficient and realizable production process. Based on extensive preliminary works a state-of-the-art process has been proposed that integrates a solar-photocatalytic hydrogen production step (driven by the photonic portion of solar irradiance) with a high-temperature solar thermochemical oxygen evolution step (driven from the thermal portion) and efficient thermal energy storage as part of the cycle operation. Present work investigates the theoretical and engineering aspects of the proposed HySA process. It also provides an updated assessment and discussion of the related cycles and developments, of the photocatalysts, and analyzes the thermodynamics and implications of the reactions involved.

These models are popular due to their speed and low input requirements. One often-used simplification is the assumption that emissions are homogeneously distributed in the entire length and width of the street canyon. It is thus the aim of the present study to analyse the impact of this assumption by implementing an inhomogeneous emission geometry scheme in OSPM. The homogeneous and the inhomogeneous emission geometry schemes are validated against two real-world cases: Hornsgatan, Stockholm, a sloping street canyon; and Jagtvej, Copenhagen; where the morning rush hour has more traffic on one lane compared to the other. The two cases are supplemented with a theoretical calculation of the impact of street aspect (height / width) ratio and emission inhomogeneity on the concentrations resulting from inhomogeneous emissions. The results show an improved performance for the inhomogeneous emission geometry over the homogeneous emission geometry. Moreover, it is shown that the impact of inhomogeneous emissions is largest for near-parallel wind directions and for high aspect ratio canyons. The results from the real-world cases are however confounded by challenges estimating the emissions accurately.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN1302" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Experimental and numerical investigation of the aperture size effect on the efficient solar energy harvesting for solar thermochemical applications</div> <div class="author"> J.

A high flux solar simulator, consisting of a 7 kW xenon short arc lamp, is employed as a light source. The sunlight intensity variations at early morning (06:30), morning (07:15) and noon (12:00) time of a reference day are imitated by changing the input current to the lamp. Experiments have been performed with different aperture diameters across selected irradiance levels to imitate sunlight variations. An optical model is developed to simulate incident flux distribution and the output is compared with the experimental measurements for validation. A finite volume algorithm is developed, based on a coupled Monte Carlo heat transfer model, to calculate the steady state temperatures in the receiver. Experimental and numerical temperatures are compared and an excellent agreement with an average temperature difference of +/- 0.2%, is observed. The optimum aperture size varies with the change in irradiance intensity and therefore the time of day. Simulations for a 30 kW light source show that the daily steady state temperature differential for fixed apertures of 8-10 cm is 170-190 K. Variable apertures reduce power consumption by half when compared to fixed apertures. Variable apertures maintain steady state temperatures of 1000 K, 1100 K and 1200 K by consuming 26.8 kW day, 33.2 kW day and 26.9 kW day, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For the first time, this article provides a comprehensive synthesis of the currently available published information which deals with atmospheric particulate matter (PM) in MEA. The focus of the article remains on the PM sources, monitoring, health impacts and source apportionment. The key objectives are to identify the levels of PM pollution and the associated exposure risks, to highlight research gaps and to discuss future research directions. The limited number of monitoring studies available for MEA indicates that dust storms augmented by the rapid increase in urban population are the key reasons for the high PM concentration levels. The findings of reviewed monitoring studies suggest that the levels of both annual mean PM10 (20 mu g/m(3)) and PM2.5 (10 mu g/m(3)) concentrations exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines during most of the non-dust storm episodes, and as expected, the PM pollution levels become even higher during dust storm episodes. For example, 24-h mean PM10 concentrations of over 1,000 mu g/m(3) were noted during a severe dust storm episode in Kuwait. The findings of the epidemiological and toxicological studies in MEA have shown that dust storm events have a significant impact on respiratory admissions and the adverse health effects of PM are particularly in the form of asthma and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. It is concluded that PM pollution in MEA is a significant problem and quantification of PM emissions and the design of control measures to abate their impacts on public health are of primary importance. Besides, there is a need for more systematic PM data collection for source apportionment and assessment of PM levels that would enable air pollution-related health impact assessments of MEA. Furthermore, this review highlights that the release of airborne PM from major building activities such as building construction is largely unknown and emission inventories for different situations are needed.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2014</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN1122" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Use of Dispersion Modelling for the Assessment of Primary Particulate Matter Sources on the Air Quality of Greater Thessaloniki Area</div> <div class="author"> A.

In this paper an effort has been made, to determine the impact, on local air quality, of both anthropogenic and natural sources located in and nearby the GTA. The CALMET/CALPUFF modeling system has been employed to estimate hourly PM concentration levels. A detailed emission inventory was developed using literature and own calculations for an area of 25 km radius with variable resolution from 1 km to 5 km. It has thus, been shown, that the main causes of local high levels are the industrial activities, followed by the car traffic. The PM10 from residential heating significantly impacts air quality during winter months and its contribution tends to grow following the increased use of wood for heating. Agricultural activities, regardless of the fact that produce huge amounts of PM, affect mainly the rural areas of the GTA, in the months they occur. On the other hand, it was found that the non-irrigated land creates a great burden for GTA, even without considering the re-suspension of the PM. Finally the sea spray contributes constantly a small part in the whole problem.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2013</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN3312" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Application of Detached Eddy Simulation to neighbourhood scale gases atmospheric dispersion modelling</div> <div class="author"> K.

The existence of many such industrial plants close to a densely populated area can have a severe effect on human health. The effects can be even worse when these emissions are added to existing background concentration levels. This study deals with the assessment of the primary particulate matter pollution caused by industrial activities close to the city of Thessaloniki in Greece. An atmospheric dispersion and regulatory model was employed, i.e. AERMOD from the US Environmental Pollution Agency. A new PM10 emission sources inventory was prepared for the main industrial plants of the area and the annual and monthly average concentrations from 2003 to 2007 were calculated. The results from AERMOD were validated against data from available monitoring stations and showed reasonably good agreement. It was estimated that industry contributes approximately 30% of primary PM10 on the western suburbs of the city and about 7% in the city centre. The effect of the wind direction was also studied and it was illustrated that the frequent southwest winds present higher concentration levels than the strong north ones.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN545" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Atmospheric dispersion modelling of the fugitive particulate matter from overburden dumps with numerical and integral models</div> <div class="author"> Konstantinos E.

The uncertainty of the sampler was tested in vitro and in vivo. Twenty such outdoor passive samplers were assembled and installed at specific locations in the Greater Thessaloniki Area and measurements of PM were carried out.

Models describing pollutant levels in urban streets are thus important tools in air pollution management as a supplement to measurements in routine monitoring programmes. A widely used model in this context is the fast and easy to apply Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM). For almost 20 years, OSPM has been routinely used in many countries for studying traffic pollution, performing analyses of field campaign measurements, studying efficiency of pollution abatement strategies, carrying out exposure assessments and as reference in comparisons to other models. OSPM is generally considered as state-of-the-art in applied street pollution modelling. This paper outlines the most important findings in OSPM validation and application studies in literature. At the end of the paper, future research needs are outlined for traffic air pollution modelling in general but with outset in the research performed with OSPM.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN662" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">European Workshop on Teaching Safety in Chemical Engineering</div> <div class="author"> K.E.

To validate this approach, NOx and NO2 measurements were employed in addition to data for PM10. The good agreement observed allowed the prediction of PM10 concentrations in all streets in the historical city centre.

OSPM (Operational Street Pollution Model) is one of the most widely used empirical-box models due to its simplicity and its very good performance. However, in most cases the necessary data, even for such simple computations, are not all available, leading to large errors, especially when employed for future planning. The City of Thessaloniki (Greece) was studied as an example, as although few input-data are available, there are enough measurements to validate the model’s results. The current work proposes a methodology for dealing with this lack of data, confirmed by comparison with measured values.

The overall uncertainty in the absolute values of the density is estimated to be one of +/- 0.7% for aluminum and 0.8% for iron, which is worse than that of the most optimistic claims but recognizes the unexplained discrepancies between different methods.

Modern cities face modem threats/problems. Accidental or intentional release of lethal toxic gases is one of them. A new computer model was constructed for the calculation of toxic gases dispersion in urban terrains in micro scale, extended to an area of I km x I km. The model consists of three individual modules: a mesh-generator (structured mesh of linear quadrilateral elements), a processor (flow and advection-diffusion solver) and a post-processor (graphical representation of the phenomena). The well-established finite element method was used to solve firstly the Navier-Stokes equation in order to acquire the steady-state velocity profile and secondly the advection-diffusion equation to acquire the transient concentration distribution. All three modules of the model were implemented to a computer software by using the Microsoft .NET (R) programming environment. In order to evaluate the model’s preliminary results in 2D, numerous simulations were collected from wind tunnel experiments and other CFD software. The model’s main algorithms and its advantages are presented in this work.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2004</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="RN399" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Thermal conductivity of reference solid materials</div> <div class="author"> M.

The technique employed is the transient hot-wire technique, and measurements cover a temperature range from room temperature up to 570 K. The technique is applied here in a novel way that eliminates all remaining contact resistances. This allows the apparatus to operate in an absolute way. The method makes use of a soft silicone paste material between the hot wires of the technique and the solid of interest. Measurements of the transient temperature rise of the wires in response to an electrical heating step in the wires over a period of 20 mus up to 20 s allow an absolute determination of the thermal conductivity of the solid, as well as of the silicone paste. The method is based on a full theoretical model with equations solved by a two-dimensional finite-element method applied to the exact geometry. At the 95% confidence level, the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity measurements is 0.1% for Pyrex 7740, 0.4% for Pyroceram 9606, and 0.2% for stainless steel AISI 304L, while the standard uncertainty of the technique is less than 1.5%.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 You R.
